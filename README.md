# Compound Interest Calculator in Python

This program calculates the future balance of an investment based on the starting principal, annual interest rate, and investment duration (with annual compounding of interest).

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Download `interest calculator.py`.
3. Run the program from the terminal using the command: `python "interest calculator.py"`
4. Input the starting principal, interest rate, and number of years.

## What I Learned / Concepts Demonstrated
* Receiving and converting user input (`input()` and `int()`).
* Applying mathematical formulas (the compound interest formula: $Total = Principal \times (\frac{InterestRate}{100} + 1)^{Time}$).
* Using `while` loops to allow the user to perform multiple calculations.
* Creating a function (`want_continue`) to ask if the user wants to continue.
* Formatted output to present the results clearly.
